## What is SecureSymmetric üØÑ

In general it's a cool name for the project but actually it's just a simple program that encrypts file using fernet's symmetric secret key based authenticated cryptography.

## üìë NOTE

> [!NOTE]
> As said earlier, this is just a simple code that we wrote to learn about how symmetric encrytion works and the usage of fernet. This is totally a personal project and we are not a good developer at all, so please test the code on test files before using on your important files. Feel free to make necessary changes from your side.
